  desc 'The Tomcat <Connector> element controls the TLS protocol and the associated ciphers used. If a strong cipher is not selected, an attacker may be able to circumvent encryption protections that are configured for the connector. Strong ciphers must be employed when configuring a secured connector.

The configuration attribute and its values depend on what HTTPS implementation the user is utilizing. The user may be utilizing either Java-based implementation aka JSSE — with BIO and NIO connectors, or OpenSSL-based implementation — with APR connector.

TLSv1.2 ciphers are configured via the server.xml file on a per connector basis.  For a list of approved ciphers, refer to NIST SP 800-52 section 3.3.1.1.'

sudo grep -i ciphers $CATALINA_BASE/conf/server.xml.

Examine each <Connector/> element that is not a redirect to a secure port. Identify the ciphers that are configured on each connector and determine if any of the ciphers are not secure.

For a list of approved ciphers, refer to NIST SP 800-52 section 3.3.1.1.

If insecure ciphers are configured for use, this is a finding.'
